## 📘 Overview

This repository demonstrates **data preprocessing, feature engineering, and visualization** using the **Housing dataset**.  
It’s designed to showcase **Business Analytics and Data Science skills** — particularly for those aspiring to become **Data Analysts**, **Business Analysts**, or **Analytics Interns**.

The project includes:
- Converting categorical variables to numerical form  
- Standardizing features using `StandardScaler`  
- Generating correlation heatmaps  
- Creating histograms for distribution analysis  
- Using libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `scikit-learn`

| `area` | Total area (in sq. ft) |
| `bedrooms`, `bathrooms` | Property size indicators |
| `mainroad`, `guestroom`, `basement` | Boolean features (yes/no) |
| `hotwaterheating`, `airconditioning` | Utility indicators |
| `prefarea` | Preferred locality (yes/no) |
| `furnishingstatus` | Furnishing type (`furnished`, `semi-furnished`, `unfurnished`) |

📊 Visualizations
Correlation Heatmap

Distribution Histograms

Feature Relationships

python
Copy code
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(10,10))
sns.heatmap(df.corr(), annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.show()

df.hist(figsize=(10,10), bins=10)
plt.show()
💡 Results & Insights
Numerical encoding of categorical features improved data readability.

Standardization allowed balanced scaling of price and area.

Visualizations revealed strong correlations between area, price, and certain amenities.

The dataset is well-prepared for future regression or machine learning tasks.

🔮 Future Enhancements
Add Linear Regression / Decision Tree models for price prediction.

Build interactive dashboards using Streamlit or Power BI.

Automate data cleaning pipelines for real-world data ingestion.
